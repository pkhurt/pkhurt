# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm glad you're here. Here's a little overview of me and my projects.

## About Me

I'm Peter, a passionate developer from ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. With a love for technology, digital maps, innovation and music, I work on a variety of projects ranging from music practice helper apps to machine learning and data analysis.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub Actions, Deep Learning and constantly working on databases. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a practice helper python tool that can act as a call and response as well as a random practice item generator.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects or QGIS tools.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music and how to practice, digital maps or HD Maps as well as python and github actions.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Just send me a message on "LinkedIn".
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can play Marimba, too.

## Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:

### [Hands on machine learning]
In this repository I programmed along with exercises of the book [Hands On Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by [Aurelien Geron](https://www.oreilly.com/search?q=author:%22AurÃ©lien%20GÃ©ron%22) to learn more of the world of machine learning using Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. I also applied what I learned to other small examples like a Meme classifier and a spotify music classifier to find out what memes are funny and what music I like based on labelled data.

- [Hands On Machine Learning](https://github.com/pkhurt/hands-on-machine-learning)
- Highlights:
  - Classification Machine Learning algorithms
  - Meme Classifier
  - Spotify playlist generator

### [Blockchain]
In this small project I implemented a blockchain using python and the framework flask. I implemented my own mining algorithm to get to know the topics better.

- [Blockchain](https://github.com/pkhurt/blockchain)
- Highlights:
  - flask server: To keep the user interaction simple I used flask
  - Transactions have been possible
  - Mining a new building block for the blockchain was also implemented
